# Growth Spark Starter Theme - /includes/ Folder                           
                                
USAGE:

All PHP files placed in this directory and the root of any direct sub-directories (includes/your-folder-name) are automatically included by the theme, so you do NOT have to include them in functions.php.  

In order for new files to be included, their names must be prefixed with one of the following:

* cpt.     (for Custom Post Types)

* widget.  (for Custom Widgets)

* dashboard. (for Dashboard Widgets)

* inc.     (generic includes prefix for all other files)

Filenames containing the word "sample" will never be included (ie widget.sample.php, cpt.sample.php)
