# Growth Spark Starter Theme - /includes/ Folder                           
                                
USAGE:

* All PHP files placed in this directory and the root of any direct sub-directories (includes/your-folder-name) are automatically included by the theme, so you do NOT have to include them in functions.php.  

* In order for new files to be included, their names must be prefixed with one of the following:

** cpt.     (for Custom Post Types)

** widget.  (for Custom Widgets)

** inc.     (generic includes prefix for all other files)

* Filenames containing the word "sample" will never be included (ie widget.sample.php, cpt.sample.php)
